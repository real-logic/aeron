This build uses Gradle Build Scans to gather statistics, share information about 
failures, environmental issues, dependencies resolved during the build and more.
Build scans will be published after each build, if you accept the terms of 
service, and in particular the privacy policy.
Please read 
   
    https://gradle.com/terms-of-service 
    https://gradle.com/legal/privacy
and then:
  - set the `AERON_GRADLE_SCANS_ACCEPT` to `yes`/`no` if you agree with/refuse the TOS
  - or create the ${acceptFile} file with `yes`/`no` in it if you agree with/refuse
And we'll not bother you again. Note that build scans are only made public if 
you share the URL at the end of the build.
